Overview of Core Research Experiences
======
1. **Undergraduate Research Assistant at Institute of Russian, Eurasian, European Studies (February 2021 - Present).** I led a 3 year Sentiment Analysis study of online reviews, primarily using Python and Tableau. My research questions were: 1) How can I implement and apply NLP Sentiment Analysis techniques to analyze online reviews from TripAdvisor?, 2) How can I generalize my approach to other domains outside of tourism (e.g., product reviews on Amazon)?
   
   Stakeholders: National Science Foundation (NSF), Sustainability Institute, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Norway
   
2. **AI/ML Engineer at MITRE (May 2023 - May 2024).** I researched AI governance, computer vision, risk management frameworks (NIST, CHAI), and responsible AI. My research question was: How can I create ethical, trustworthy, and reliable AI systems for the betterment of society? 
   
   Stakeholders: Department of Defense (DoD) - National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA)
   
3. **Master's Thesis (August 2025 - Present)**. I am advised by Dr. Ayah Zirkly & Dr. Robert Orttung. My research question was: How does the performance of common ML metrics (F1, precision, recall, cross-validation) for sentiment analysis tasks change between different model architectures (rule-based, deep learning, machine learning) and different datasets (synthetic and man-made)?
   
   Stakeholders: School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS), Sustainability Institute
   
4. **Independent Projects (August 2025 - Present)**
   1. Building an LLM Model From Scratch (coming to Github soon!)
   2. Design, Build, Deploy, And Improve ML & Statistical Models To Analyze Structured And Unstructured Datasets (coming to Github soon!)
   3. Train, Validate, and Optimize Models Using Large Datasets (coming to Github soon!)
