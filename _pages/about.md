I am currently a Master's student at The George Washington University, studying Computer Science. I am part of the Joint BA & MS in Computer Science (CS) program at GW. I took an interdisciplinary approach to my undergrad education by tailoring my undergrad degree to blend coursework in Business and Sustainability in addition to CS. I started my career as an International Affairs major because I was interested in the intersection of tech, science, and policy. After taking an introductory course in Python programming, I found that I was much more passionate about the technical side of computer science. As a Master's student, I am grateful for my preliminary studies in International Affairs because it directly aligns with my work in AI Goverance, a topic I am interested in researching within my PhD. 

As I pursued my coursework at GW, I simultaneously acquired 4+ years of professional experience in AI/ML: moving from academic research to w to defense consulting. Along the way, I engaged in independent projects focused around NLP (emedding, tokenization, LLMs). These experiences have led me to my master's thesis in which I am studying the relationship between types of datasets (synthetic and original) and model architectures (rule-based, deep learning, machine learning). I am evaluating this relationship by comparing the performance of state of the art NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Gemini) on sentiment analysis tasks, using common ML metrics (F1, precision, recall, cross-validation). I seek to understand why the models are failing in prescribing sentiment to certain online reviews, finding patterns in the language of the reviews.  Through this way, I have become skilled in a technical (machine learning, data science, deep learning) and non-technical domain (leadership, team collaboration, interpersonal communication), preparing me well for future opportunities. 


My Career Goals
======
My short term goal is to pursue a PhD in CS in Fall 2026. My long term goal is to become a Professor and mentor young minds! I want to dedicate my life to conducting high-impact research, leading research groups in socially responsible AI. 


Research Interests 
======
My research intersects natural language processing, responsible AI, and human-AI interaction. I aim to develop and engage in research dedicated to creating user-friendly and trustworthy interfaces that provide easy human-robot task communication. This research is **difficult** for many reasons, however I am particularly focused on 2  notions: 

* 1)language models are a "black-box" and thus lack the transparency and ethics to be used in society
* 2)there is a gap between cutting edge language models and their understanding of human intent, leading to miscommunication between humans and AI-driven systems. 


Core Strengths
======
1. **Curious** (I am always looking to advance my knolwedge using textbooks, peer reviewed articles, blog posts; I have compiled my research into a giant respository, going from fundamentals to advanced topics. I use this work to help me identify research gaps for my PhD, decipher journal articles, keep track of emerging trends in fields such as NLP).
2. **Transparent** (I am a big advocate for model documentation because it makes AI systems transparent and less of a "black-box". To that end, I am transparent about how I make decisions and conclusions in my research.)
