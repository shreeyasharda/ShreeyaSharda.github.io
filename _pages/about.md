My goal is to give future employers, advisors, and other collaborators a **snapshot** of my technical and soft skills. 


About Me
======
I am currently a Master's student at The George Washington University, studying Computer Science. I am part of the Joint BA & MS in Computer Science (CS) program at GW. I took an interdisciplinary approach to my undergrad education by tailoring my undergrad degree to blend coursework in Business and Sustainability in addition to CS. I started my career as an International Affairs major because I was interested in the intersection of tech, science, and policy. After taking an introductory course in Python programming, I found that I was much more passionate about the technical side of computer science. As a Master's student, I am grateful for my preliminary studies in International Affairs because it directly aligns with my work in AI Goverance, a topic I am interested in researching within my PhD. 

As I pursued my coursework at GW, I simultaneously acquired 4+ years of professional experience in AI/ML: moving from academic research to w to defense consulting. Along the way, I engaged in independent projects focused around NLP (emedding, tokenization, LLMs). These experiences have led me to my master's thesis in which I am studying the relationship between types of datasets (synthetic and original) and model architectures (rule-based, deep learning, machine learning). I am evaluating this relationship by comparing the performance of state of the art NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Gemini) on sentiment analysis tasks, using common ML metrics (F1, precision, recall, cross-validation). I seek to understand why the models are failing in prescribing sentiment to certain online reviews, finding patterns in the language of the reviews.  Through this way, I have become skilled in a technical (machine learning, data science, deep learning) and non-technical domain (leadership, team collaboration, interpersonal communication), preparing me well for future opportunities. 


My Career Goals
======
My short term goal is to pursue a PhD in CS in Fall 2026. My long term goal is to become a Professor and mentor young minds! I want to dedicate my life to conducting high-impact research, leading research groups in socially responsible AI. 


Research Interests 
======

My research intersects natural language processing, responsible AI, and human-robot interaction. I aim to develop and engage in research dedicated to creating user-friendly and trustworthy interfaces that provide easy human-robot task communication. This research is **difficult** for many reasons, however I am particularly focused on 2  notions: 1)language models are a "black-box" and thus lack the transparency and ethics to be used in society and 2)there is a gap between cutting edge language models and their understanding of human intent, leading to miscommunication between humans and AI-driven systems. 

**Technical Areas**
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Machine Learning (ML)
3. Deep Learning (DL)
4. Computer Vision (CV) (object detection and image classification tasks) 
5. Human-Robotic Interaction (HRI)
6. Human-AI Interaction 


**Non-Technical Areas**
1. Casual Inference
2. AI Governance (e.g., Fairness, Bias, AI Risk Management, NIST, CHAI, Responsible AI)
3. Social Impact (e.g., Investigating how different algorithmic choices impact different demographics)
4. AI Safety & Ethics for Trustworthy AI


**Specific HRI/Robotics Topics**
1. Integration of multiple data modalities
2. Increased focus on explainability and ethical considerations
3. Improved cross-cultural capabilities
4. Increased collaboration between human researchers and AI systems



Research Experiences
======
1. **Undergraduate Research Assistant at Institute of Russian, Eurasian, European Studies (February 2021 - Present).** I led a 3 year Sentiment Analysis study of online reviews, primarily using Python and Tableau. My research questions were: 1) How can I implement and apply NLP Sentiment Analysis techniques to analyze online reviews from TripAdvisor?, 2) How can I generalize my approach to other domains outside of tourism (e.g., product reviews on Amazon)?
   
   Stakeholders: National Science Foundation (NSF), Sustainability Institute, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Norway
   
2. **AI/ML Engineer at MITRE (May 2023 - May 2024).** I researched AI governance, computer vision, risk management frameworks (NIST, CHAI), and responsible AI. My research question was: How can I create ethical, trustworthy, and reliable AI systems for the betterment of society? 
   
   Stakeholders: Department of Defense (DoD) - National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA)
   
3. **Master's Thesis (August 2025 - Present)**. I am advised by Dr. Ayah Zirkly & Dr. Robert Orttung. My research question was: How does the performance of common ML metrics (F1, precision, recall, cross-validation) for sentiment analysis tasks change between different model architectures (rule-based, deep learning, machine learning) and different datasets (synthetic and man-made)?
   
   Stakeholders: School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS), Sustainability Institute

4. **Data Scientist at Intrinsic, a health-based startup of 50+ employees (June 2022 - October 2022).** I researched data annotation, designing ML pipelines to make predictions about pricing strategies given current customer behavior. 
   
5. **Independent Projects (August 2025 - Present)**
   1. Building an LLM Model From Scratch (coming to Github soon!)
   2. Design, Build, Deploy, And Improve ML & Statistical Models To Analyze Structured And Unstructured Datasets (coming to Github soon!)
   3. Train, Validate, and Optimize Models Using Large Datasets (coming to Github soon!)




Core Strengths
======
**Strengths**
1. **Curious** (I am always looking to advance my knolwedge using textbooks, peer reviewed articles, blog posts; I have compiled my research into a giant respository, going from fundamentals to advanced topics. I use this work to help me identify research gaps for my PhD, decipher journal articles, keep track of emerging trends in fields such as NLP).
2. **Transparent** (I am a big advocate for model documentation because it makes AI systems transparent and less of a "black-box". To that end, I am transparent about how I make decisions and conclusions in my research.)
